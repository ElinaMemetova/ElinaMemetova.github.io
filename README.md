# GraphQL

### About

The objective of this project was to learn the GraphQL query language, by creating my own profile page.
I used the GraphQL endpoint which is provided by the platform (https://01.kood.tech/api/graphql-engine/v1/graphql) to query the data necessary to fill the page.

The profile has 4 sections: **information about student**, **audit ratio**, **skills** and **xp by project**.

In the project there are 3 graphs. One is a spider graph that displays skill data and the other two are the graphs that displays xp progression over time and audit ratio. You can see more info when hovering over a graph.

More info about the subject [here](https://01.kood.tech/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/graphql)

### Testing / auditing

Audit questions [here](https://01.kood.tech/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/graphql/audit)

The page is being hosted at [github-pages](https://ElinaMemetova.github.io/graphql).

You can test the code yourself by using "Live Server" extention on VScode
